The widgets shown here are all made with [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww).
Starting from the left, the first is a power menu widget that allows the user to access power options. Right next to it is a Spotify widget integrated with Cava, displaying colors corresponding to the song's artwork. Next is a customized simple calendar designed to fit the theme, followed by a panel with various user-friendly options and functionalities.

Set up a simple Neofetch configuration and a Kitty color palette to match the mauve theme.

Mauve rofi setup ([Not mine](https://github.com/m4xshen/dotfiles/tree/mauve/rofi/rofi)).

Adding to that i created a sweet animations using a picom fork [picom-pijulius](https://github.com/pijulius/picom) that can be seen on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1829ew5/qtile_i_like_purple/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

You are welcome to copy any of my dotfiles or scripts you come across here.However, I advise against attempting to duplicate the entire setup, as it lacks organization and is tailored to my specific requirements.


**NOTE**:These widgets are done on a `1080x1920` resolution screen with nvidia drivers.


**NOTE**:If the icons didn't load try installing `Symbols Nerd Fonts` & `JetBrains Nerd Fonts`.
